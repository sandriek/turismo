On this corner you will see on the other side an important monument in the history of Breda: the monastic barracks. It is a part of the former sister monastery of St. Catharinadal, which was located here since 1295. The current building dates back to 1504. In 1645 the sisters were Norbertinessen from Breda to Oosterhout driven out.
