19. At the end of the St. John's street turn right onto Mill Street.

In the Mill Street you will see the law library, designed by architect Herman Hertzberger. Because the Mill Street quite narrow, the architect space created by the library cant sloping walls. On the site of the library (on the corner with Oude Vest) was used to be a port. Above this gate stood Gevangenhuys, where the most gestraften's Heeren were accommodated. The place is still with pebbles in the asphalt; the asphalt road is the site of the old Canal.
