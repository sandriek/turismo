Many designs of Aldo Rossi (1931-1997) are in the border area of the Visual Arts and architecture. Maybe the best way to characterize his work as Visual architecture. The work of art in Breda is a spatial, architectural model and clearly recognizable as lighthouse. The 18-metre high work functions not only as oktagonale lighthouse, it is not accessible in this urban environment on a creatures strange place.

Aldo Rossi was one of the post modern architects who are starting from the sixties returned in their eyes against the dogmatic rationality and functionality of the new architecture. Rossi gained huge fame with his 1966 book ' L'architettura della città ' and with projects like ' Teatro del Mondo ' for the Venice Biennale in 1979. The post modern architects found that architecture was more than function. They referred with their designs to archetypes and historical examples, took advantage of the symbolic value of colors and shapes and locks are not a means to come to an expressive force of an object. And while architectural designs by definition assume a function, gobbling up not back them to develop projects that served no other purpose than to evoke memories, associations to give free rein, or fantasy to titillate: architecture as image.
