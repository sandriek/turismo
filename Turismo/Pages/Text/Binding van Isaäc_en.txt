A particular work of art, here somewhat tucked under the shadows of the trees, the Vlaszak. What the image illustrates exactly is a question for many Bredanaren. It's just a rusty image? It might be a bull? The 7.5 metres high art work is the work of the Israeli artist Menashe Kadishman. The rust brown statue represents the ' Binding of Isaac ' for. The image gives a story from the Bible in which Abraham instructed his son Isaac to sacrifice. At the last moment keeps an Angel Abraham. He sacrifices instead of his own son a, in the bushes, ram on.
