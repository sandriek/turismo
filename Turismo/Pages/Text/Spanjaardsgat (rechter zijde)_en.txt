To strengthen the castle of Breda built Count Henry III in 1509 two defense towers, the grenade Tower (left) and the pigeon Tower (right). The water gate in the ramparts is Spanjaardsgat. The name refers to a list by Mountains to the Spaniards. After historical studies have shown that this is not the appropriate place, but the name Spanjaardsgat. There are regular events at the Spanjaardsgat organized, such as the Spanjaardsgatfestival and the Breda Jazz Festival. There is then a floating stage built in the water. The decor of the Spanjaardsgat with the Defense towers gives the whole a special atmosphere.
