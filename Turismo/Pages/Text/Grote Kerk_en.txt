The 15th-century great church was built by the (orange), House of the ancestors of our Royal House. The Regal look is not only apparent in the imposing exterior of the building, but also in the tombs, arched and murals in the building.

Very particular is the chapel with its gold leaf-lined ceiling, where the ancestors of our Royal family are buried. The great Church also offers a stunning setting and atmosphere for holding various kinds of meetings from 10 to 1000 people.
